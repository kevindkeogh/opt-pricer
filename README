Demonstration of a Black-Scholes Model in C

Note that there are two models, a pure Monte Carlo implementation
and the closed form Black-Scholes equation. Note that the code runs
multi-threaded and the random numbers are a sobol sequence.

Recommended number of simulations is 100,000,000 for Gamma convergence, the
other Greeks converge by 1,000,000.

LICENSE:
	My code, which comprises most of the routine functionality, is MIT.
	There are two functions,
		i8_sobol_generate - generate sobol sequence
		r8_normal_01_cdf_inverse - calculate inverse normal cdf
	which are LGPL. The Makefile compiles them as a separate shared object
	and dynamically links them. The files are included (with minor
	adjustments to make it compile) in src.

TODO:
	1. Tests...
	2. Update windows cross-compilation, currently broken
